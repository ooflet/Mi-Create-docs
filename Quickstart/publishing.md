## Prerequisites 
{ .info}
The .FACE file in your project's output folder is your watchface binary. Rename it to .bin if you are uploading to another service.

We're assuming that you are attempting to publish onto m0tral's servers. If you do not have access already to them, please follow the guide on https://ooflet.github.io/docs/quickstart/testing#preparations. If you are uploading your watchface on another service like AmazfitWatchFaces, please follow instructions there on how to upload a watchface.

## Publishing

Before publishing your watchface for others to see, please follow the guide at https://ooflet.github.io/docs/quickstart/testing to upload your watchface onto testing servers if you have not done so already. Once everything is tested and ready, press the ![publish](../Images/publish-button.png) Publish button on the left of your watchface listing to publish it to servers. Select categories by pressing the edit button and remember to check "active" to TRUE.

Congratulations! ðŸ¥³ You have uploaded your watchface for everyone to see!

## Monetisation

Monetisation is only available for Russian citizens at the moment due to political tensions.

Please contact @m0tral on Telegram if you wish to sell your watchface.
