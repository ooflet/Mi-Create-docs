Kommand is a merge between a Terminal and the Developer Console, allowing developers to run commands while viewing code output alongside.

## Kommand's interface

| No.  | Description                                                         |

| 1    | Prefix Character - Shows which mode your command is running in      |
| 2    | Command Bar - Input box for commands. Press the `'` key to activate |


Simple, right? Those 2 are the only things that you interact with to use Kommand.

## Command Bar

This is where you would type commands in. You can use the up and down arrow keys to cycle between entered commands.
