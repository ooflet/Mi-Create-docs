## Creating a Watchface

Mi Create is a watchface creation tool. It is a graphical program for creating and editing custom watchfaces on Xiaomi wearables.

**Widgets** are the components of your watchface, things like images, analog hands, digital numbers, etc. The **Canvas** is the part of the program where your watchface is previewed and editable. **Building** is the act of compiling your watchface project into a format thats readable by the watch.

Create a watchface by pressing `Ctrl` + `N` or by pressing the ![New Project Icon](../Images/file-plus.png)`New Project` link in the Welcome page. You will be greeted by the New Project dialog.

![Alt text](../Images/project-dialog.png)

Start by selecting the device you want to make your watchface for in the Select device dropdown, naming your project and setting where the project will be created.

From here, a blank watchface canvas will be displayed. Zoom in and out of the canvas by clicking in the canvas and pressing `Ctrl` `+` / `Ctrl` `-`. Alternatively, you can hold `Ctrl` and scroll your mouse wheel, or simply pressing the ![Zoom In](../Images/zoom-in.png) Zoom In and ![Zoom Out](../Images/zoom-out.png) Zoom Out buttons on the toolbar.

## Adding and Configuring Widgets

To create a widget, press the ![Plus Icon](../Images/plus.png) create button on the top left and select a widget on the dropdown that appears. It will be created to the center of the watchface. 

![Add Widget Dropdown](../Images/add-widget.png)

Once the widget has been created and selected, head over to the Properties panel to modify the position and appearance of the widget.

## Adding Images

All widgets require images to display, Digital Number widgets require a list of images to represent numbers, Analog widgets require images to represent the hands of an analog clock, and the Image widget requires a static image to display.

To add an image, press the ![Image Plus](../Images/image-plus.png) `Add Image` button which is located at the bottom of the resources panel. 

![Resource Panel Buttons](../Images/resource-buttons.png)

Once the image is added, you may either drag and drop the image onto the image field, or select the dropdown to the right of the field to show a list of all the available images and select your image from there.

![Dropdown](../Images/image-dropdown.png)

If your image is not there in the dropdown, reselect the object.
